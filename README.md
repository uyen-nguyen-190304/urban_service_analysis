## Introduction

The aim of this project is to analyze the distribution and efficiency of city services within San Francisco's neighborhoods, with a focus on the month of November 2023. By scrutinizing service request data, we plan to identify patterns and potential disparities in the city's response to its communities.

## Data Source and Scope

Our primary data source is the SF311 service request dataset, available through the City of San Francisco's public data portal. The dataset encompasses records from 2008 to 2023, but our analysis will specifically concentrate on the data from November 2023. This narrowed focus allows for a detailed and timely examination of current service request trends.

- Conduct a comparative analysis to discern service request patterns across different neighborhoods.
- Utilize various data visualization techniques to effectively present our findings.

### Statistical Approaches

- Apply regression analysis to investigate correlations and determine the significance of the trends identified.

## Projected Outcomes

- Uncover patterns in the frequency and resolution times of service requests specific to November 2023.
- Gain insights into the distribution of various types of service requests across the city.
- Develop an understanding of the relationship between city services and community needs during this period.

## Broader Implications

The findings from this focused study will offer valuable insights for city planners and policymakers, especially in terms of resource allocation and addressing inequalities in service distribution. These insights are crucial for shaping future urban development and public service management strategies.
